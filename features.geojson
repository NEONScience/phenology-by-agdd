        "Overview": "The Bartlett Experimental Forest is an actively managed forest; managed portions (30%) reflect a range of forest patch sizes and structural distributions.\nSite history\nThe Bartlett forest has a history of logging dating from colonial times through the beginning of the 20th century. Approximately 70% of the land area has remained uncut since the early 1900s. Natural disturbances include late 19th century fire, beech scale-Nectria complex (beech bark disease) beginning in the 1940s, severe wind disturbance resulting from hurricanes in 1938 and 1954 and a damaging ice storm in 1998.\nTotal data products planned for this site: 116\n",

Bartlett Experimental Forest also represents the most Northeastern NEON site, and anchors the top of the north-south nitrogen deposition gradient along the eastern-side of the US.\nVegetation\nThe Bartlett site is primarily Eastern Deciduous, boreal ecotone. Nearly all of the Bartlett Experimental Forest is now covered by high forest. The primary forest cover type is the sugar maple-beech-yellow birch type. The upper elevations support stands of spruce and fir. Softwoods such as hemlock, balsam fir and spruce are commonly mixed with hardwoods, especially on cool steep slopes or on the poorly drained soils at lower elevations. Although white pine occurs mostly in stands at lower elevations, scattered specimens can be found over a large part of the forest. The site provides the deciduous-to-boreal forest transitional ecotone towards the ecosystems in the North.\nGeology: \nWhite mountain plutonic-volcanic succession, conway granite.  Middle to late Jurassic.\nUSGS HUC: h01060002\nDominant Phenology Species:\nFagus grandifolia, Tsuga canadensis, Acer pensylvanicum\nMean Canopy Height:\nThe mean canopy height is 23 m.\nSoil Family:\nCoarse-loamy, isotic, frigid.  Aquic Haplorthods.\nWind Direction:\nThe dominant wind direction is south.\n"

        "Site Characteristics": "History\nRegion-wide logging for pine in the late 1800s and early to mid-1900's led to clear-cutting of most forested areas on the property. The main parcel was donated to the University in the 1930s. Timber harvest continued into the 1950s and later, leaving a mixture of successional forest regrowth. Since the 1970s, the site has been minimally managed to maintain access for recreational, educational and research goals.\nVegetation\nThe UNDERC property primarily includes second-growth Northern mesic forest with dominant species including, red and sugar maple (Acer rubrum and A. saccharum), aspen (Populus tremuloides and P. grandidentata) ) and paper birch (Betula papyrifera.). Evergreen forests are dominated by balsam fir (Abies balsamea) and may also include hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) and in the numerous wet areas, cedar (Thuja occidentalis) and black spruce (Picea mariana).\nPoorly drained soils on the site can give rise to open, acidic sphagnum bogs dotted with tamarack (Larix laricina), black spruce and Ericaceous shrubs. Marshes surround numerous lakes including Crampton Lake, a co-located NEON aquatics site. Some wetlands are dominated by thickets of alder (Alnus incana subsp. rugosa).\nClimate\nClimate is generally humid, cool and wet with an annual average of 37.6º F at nearby Land O’ Lakes, WI with no true dry season. Temperature averages range from a low of -3.8º F and high of 49.7º F Annual precipitation is approximately 33 inches with 114 inches of snow.\nGeology: \n Migmatitic gneiss and amphobole. Late to Early Archean.\nUSGS HUC: h04020102\nDominant Phenology Species:\nAcer saccharum, Populus tremuloides, Corylus cornuta\nMean Canopy Height:\nThe mean canopy height is 24 m.\nSoil Family:\nCoarse, loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid. Argic Fragiaquods.\nWind Direction:\nThe dominant wind direction is south-southwest.\nSite Specific Topics\nLand use and specifically forest management, is one of the major science themes the Great Lakes Domain will study. The UNDERC property represents a regenerating, minimally managed forest that is characteristic of the region. This site was selected in contrast with other Great Lakes sites, Treehaven and Steigerwaldt which have varying forestry management history/management and planned future use.\n \n\n \n\n"

Yacolt Burn State Forest is a relatively young growth industrial timber production forest.

        "Site Characteristics": "Sampling plots at ABBY have been established across a mixed landscape of timber plantations ranging from clear cut stands to stands planted in the mid-1960s. Several recreational paths actually cross through the field site.\nSite History\nYacolt Burn State Forest is named for the dozens of wildfires that ravaged Clark, Cowlitz and Skamania counties in southwest Washington during September 1902. With no organized system for fighting wildfires, the fires spread across nearly 239,000 acres and caused 38 deaths and widespread property losses. An extended period of hot, dry weather; high wind; an over-accumulation of timber harvest slash; and human carelessness are among the frequently cited causes of these fires. In response, the Washington Legislature established a state fire warden the following year. In 1908, private landowners formed the Washington Fire Protection Association and funded a system of fire wardens and a program of fire prevention on private lands.\nThe DNR replanted the forests and has maintained the area as working forest in order to:\n\nProtect the long-term health of the forest's ecosytems\nGenerate revenue for the state\nProvide safe, sustainable, and enjoyable recreational opportunities\n\nSite-specific Topics\n\nLocated in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains in a young forest, ABBY field site provides an interesting comparison to NEON's WREF site which is located in a nearby old growth forest that is primarily used for research.\nUrban growth west of ABBY since the early 2000s has also brought neighborhoods closer to the forest. This growth has increased the demand for a variety of recreational activities. Urban planning is an active component of the land management of this ecosystem.\n\nVegetation and Soil\nThe dominant tree species are Douglas Fir which have been planted by the DNR since the Yakolt Burn in 1902. Many shrubs grow in the forest understory, including salal, Oregon-grape, red and big huckleberries, and west coast rhododendron. Dozens of plant species grow on the forest floor, including queencup beadlily, vanilla leaf, bracken fern, beargrass, twinflower, trillium, and little pipsissewa.\nClimate\nTypical of the Northwest, ABBY experiences very wet falls, winters, and springs; and very dry summers. The nearby Columbia River Gorge affects the valley’s climate, contributing to strong winds in any season and cool, wet weather in the winter. Average annual precipitation is about 2,540 mm annually, occurring as rain or snow during fall, winter, and spring. Summers are warm and dry. Cold air draining into the valley can bring frosts almost any time of year.\n"
